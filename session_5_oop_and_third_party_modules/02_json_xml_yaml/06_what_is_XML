    XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of
rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and
machine-readable.
It is primarily used to facilitate the sharing of structured data across
different information systems, particularly via the internet, and is often used
for storing and transporting data.

Common Use Cases in Python

    XML is commonly used for configuration files in various software applications
    because of its structured format.
Data Interchange:
    XML provides a format for exchanging data between different applications or
    between different layers of an application.
Web Development:
    In web services and APIs, XML is used for sending data between a client and
    a server. It is an alternative to JSON.
Office Documents:
    Formats like Microsoft Office’s DOCX and Excel’s XLSX are based on XML for
    document structure.
