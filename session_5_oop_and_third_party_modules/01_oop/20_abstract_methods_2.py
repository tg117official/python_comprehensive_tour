### Python Script: Payment Processing System

# Let's consider a payment processing system where you have different types of payment methods
# (credit card, PayPal, etc.). Each method has its own process for making a payment, but they
# must all adhere to a basic set of operations defined in the base class.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def authenticate(self):
        """Authenticate the payment method."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        """Process the payment of the specified amount."""
        pass

class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def __init__(self, card_number, security_code):
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.security_code = security_code

    def authenticate(self):
        print(f"Authenticating card ending in {self.card_number[-4:]}")
        # Here would be the logic to authenticate the credit card
        return True

    def pay(self, amount):
        if self.authenticate():
            print(f"Processing ${amount} payment via Credit Card.")
            # Logic for processing credit card payment
        else:
            print("Credit Card authentication failed.")

class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def authenticate(self):
        print(f"Authenticating PayPal account for {self.email}")
        # Here would be the logic to authenticate PayPal account
        return True

    def pay(self, amount):
        if self.authenticate():
            print(f"Processing ${amount} payment via PayPal.")
            # Logic for processing PayPal payment
        else:
            print("PayPal authentication failed.")

# Example Usage
credit_card = CreditCardProcessor("123456789012", "123")
credit_card.pay(100)

paypal = PayPalProcessor("user@example.com")
paypal.pay(150)


### Explanation
# - Abstract Base Class (`PaymentProcessor`):
#           This class uses the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module to define
#           methods like `authenticate` and `pay`. These methods are required but do not have
#           implementation within the abstract class. Instead, they define a contract that all
#           subclasses must fulfill.
# - Subclasses (`CreditCardProcessor` and `PayPalProcessor`) :
#           These classes inherit from `PaymentProcessor` and provide specific implementations
#           for the methods defined in the abstract class. Each payment method has its unique way
#           of authenticating and processing payments.
#
# ### Real-Life Benefits
# - Consistency :
#           Ensures that all payment types implement the necessary methods (`authenticate` and
#           `pay`), providing a consistent interface for users of these classes.
# - Flexibility :
#           New payment methods can be added easily without changing the overall system; they
#           just need to implement the defined abstract methods.
# - Maintainability :
#           Changes in the payment processing steps can be localized within the subclasses,
#           not affecting other parts of the application.
#
# This structure makes the code easier to manage and extend, especially as systems grow and
# evolve with new types of payment methods or rules.
